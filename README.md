‚ö†Ô∏è This package is actively being developed and accepting PRs (see TODO section)!

A Python wrapper for coingecko.com V3 api. Other notable api wrappers that didn't satisfy my need:
- [pycoingecko](https://github.com/man-c/pycoingecko) has not been active in over two years and does not support the newer endpoints

## Features
- ‚úèÔ∏è **MyPy** Fully typed using most [recent versions](https://mypy-lang.org/)
- ‚öíÔ∏è **Modern tooling** like [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- üì• **GitHub Actions** CI/CD to automate everything
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Code Coverage** Fully tested using tools like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)
